Create a typing animation that simulates realistic text typing with a @blinking cursor. The basic structure is in place, but you need to implement three key features to make it work.

Objectives:
To make the animation look more realistic add the class and id "cursor" to the span tag.

Add white background color to the class "cursor" in CSS.
Change the text variable to "Welcome to the Typing Animation Example!" in JavaScript.
